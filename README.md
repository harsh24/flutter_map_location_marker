## Features

* **Simple**: The only thing to do is adding a `CurrentLocationLayer()` in to your map because all
  parameters have good default values.

* **Flexible**: The default implementation is receiving device's position from
  the [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) package and receiving device's heading from
  the [flutter_compass](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_compass) package, but with type conversion,
  streams from other source are also supported.

* **Auto-following**: The map follow the new location when location is updated. This feature is
  disabled by default.

* **Auto-rotating**: The map can be rotated automatically as navigation mode. This feature is
  disabled by default.

* **Customization**: The location marker can be fully customized, even the colors of accuracy circle
  and header.

## Usage

Add flutter_map_location_marker to your pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_map_location_marker: any // or latest verion
```

Add permission, please follow the instruction
from [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator#usage) package.

Add the layer widget into `FlutterMap`:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return FlutterMap(
    children: [
      TileLayer(
        urlTemplate: 'https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
        subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
        maxZoom: 19,
      ),
      CurrentLocationLayer(), // <-- add layer here
    ],
  );
}
```

Discover more parameters
in [CurrentLocationLayer](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_map_location_marker/latest/flutter_map_location_marker/CurrentLocationLayer-class.html)
.

```dart
Widget build() {
  return CurrentLocationLayer(
    followOnLocationUpdate: FollowOnLocationUpdate.always,
    turnOnHeadingUpdate: TurnOnHeadingUpdate.never,
    style: LocationMarkerStyle(
      marker: const DefaultLocationMarker(
        child: Icon(
          Icons.navigation,
          color: Colors.white,
        ),
      ),
      markerSize: const Size(40, 40),
      markerDirection: MarkerDirection.heading,
    ),
  );
}
```

If multiple location markers is needed to display, consider
using [AnimatedLocationMarkerLayer](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_map_location_marker/latest/flutter_map_location_marker/AnimatedLocationMarkerLayer-class.html)
or [LocationMarkerLayer](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_map_location_marker/latest/flutter_map_location_marker/LocationMarkerLayer-class.html)
.

## Examples

1. [Marker Customization](https://github.com/tlserver/flutter_map_location_marker/blob/master/example/lib/page/customize_marker_example.dart) :
   Change the marker to any widget you want.

2. [Floating Action Button to Follow Current Location](https://github.com/tlserver/flutter_map_location_marker/blob/master/example/lib/page/follow_fab_example.dart) :
   Use a floating action button to move and zoom the map to current location.

3. [Change Geolocator Settings](https://github.com/tlserver/flutter_map_location_marker/blob/master/example/lib/page/geolocator_settings_example.dart) :
   Define Geolocator settings yourself.

4. [Selectable Distance Filter](https://github.com/tlserver/flutter_map_location_marker/blob/master/example/lib/page/selectable_distance_filter_example.dart) :
   Change Geolocator settings at the runtime.

5. [Custom Stream](https://github.com/tlserver/flutter_map_location_marker/blob/master/example/lib/page/custom_stream_example.dart) :
   Use your own stream, such as position stream from other library or predefined route, as the
   source.

6. [No Stream](https://github.com/tlserver/flutter_map_location_marker/blob/master/example/lib/page/no_stream_example.dart) :
   Use Flutter `setState()` to update position and heading.

7. [Navigation Mode](https://github.com/tlserver/flutter_map_location_marker/blob/master/example/lib/page/navigation_example.dart) :
   Rotate the map to keep heading pointing upward.

8. [Default Stream](https://github.com/tlserver/flutter_map_location_marker/blob/master/example/lib/page/default_stream_example.dart) :
   Share the default streams between your app and this plugin.

## FAQ

*Q*: How to get
the [positionStream](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_map_location_marker/5.1.0/flutter_map_location_marker/CurrentLocationLayer/positionStream.html)
, [headingStream](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_map_location_marker/5.1.0/flutter_map_location_marker/CurrentLocationLayer/headingStream.html)
or their origin streams from a CurrentLocationLayer widget?

*A*: No. You should not get value from a widget, instead, create the stream you need and also pass
it to the widget. You may
see [this example](https://github.com/tlserver/flutter_map_location_marker/blob/master/example/lib/page/default_stream_example.dart)
to know about how to do this.
